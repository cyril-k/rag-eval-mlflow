The library consists of on-policy RL algorithms that can be\nused to train any encoder or encoder-decoder LM in the HuggingFace library\n(Wolf et al. 2020) with an arbitrary reward function.

In\nthis paper we propose a new model architecture DeBERTa (Decoding-enhanced BERT\nwith disentangled attention) that improves the BERT and RoBERTa models using\ntwo novel techniques. The first is the disentangled attention mechanism, where\neach word is represented using two vectors that encode its content and\nposition, respectively, and the attention weights among words are computed\nusing disentangled matrices on their contents and relative positions,\nrespectively. Second, an enhanced mask decoder is used to incorporate absolute\npositions in the decoding layer to predict the masked tokens in model\npre-training. In addition, a new virtual adversarial training method is used\nfor fine-tuning to improve models' generalization. We show that these\ntechniques significantly improve the efficiency of model pre-training and the\nperformance of both natural language understanding (NLU) and natural langauge\ngeneration (NLG) downstream tasks.

The question specifically asks about the size range of the language models, which is a practical concern for NLP researchers and practitioners when considering the computational resources required for different models. However, the question does not address a critical or high-impact issue that many users are likely to face, such as the effectiveness of the models in various scenarios or the ethical considerations of their use. It is a useful piece of information but does not target a critical area of concern. Therefore, the question aligns more with a moderately important aspect of NLP rather than a high-impact issue.\n[RESULT] 4", "standalone_score": 4, "standalone_feedback": "The question \"What is the size range of the language models investigated in the red teaming efforts?\" is largely standalone and makes sense without needing much additional context. It refers to the size of language models, which is a specific technical detail, but the question itself does not require knowledge of the specific context provided in the instruction to evaluate. The question is clear and can be understood independently, although it may benefit from some background knowledge about red teaming efforts to fully grasp the context in which the language models are being discussed.\n[RESULT] 4"}
{"document": {"content": "BIG-Bench (Srivastava et al., 2022) is a diverse evaluation suite that\nfocuses on tasks believed to be beyond the capabilities of current language\nmodels. Language models have already made good progress on this benchmark, with\nthe best model in the BIG-Bench paper outperforming average reported\nhuman-rater results on 65% of the BIG-Bench tasks via few-shot prompting. But\non what tasks do language models fall short of average human-rater performance,\nand are those tasks actually unsolvable by current language models?\n  In this work, we focus on a suite of 23 challenging BIG-Bench tasks which we\ncall BIG-Bench Hard (BBH). These are the task for which prior language model\nevaluations did not outperform the average human-rater. We find that applying\nchain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to BBH tasks enables PaLM to surpass the\naverage human-rater performance on 10 of the 23 tasks, and Codex\n(code-davinci-002) to surpass the average human-rater performance on 17 of the\n23 tasks. Since many tasks in BBH require multi-step reasoning, few-shot\nprompting without CoT, as done in the BIG-Bench evaluations (Srivastava et al.,\n2022), substantially underestimates the best performance and capabilities of\nlanguage models, which is better captured via CoT prompting. As further\nanalysis, we explore the interaction between CoT and model scale on BBH,\nfinding that CoT enables emergent task performance on several BBH tasks with\notherwise flat scaling curves.", "collection_id": "abe8a86a3b45f5e1d22ff7f4685cae6abb23fb99deae068ca15ad897e39d7d5c"}, "question": "What percentage of BIG-Bench tasks did the best model in the BIG-Bench paper outperform average reported human-rater results on via few-shot prompting?\n\n", "answer": "The best model in the BIG-Bench paper outperformed average reported human-rater results on 65% of the BIG-Bench tasks via few-shot prompting.", "groundedness_score": 5, "groundedness_feedback": "The question is clear and unambiguous, directly addressing the context provided.

It refers to specific technical details such as \"BIG-Bench tasks,\" \"best model,\" \"average reported human-rater results,\" and \"few-shot prompting,\" which are all relevant to the context given. However, the question does not explicitly mention the context of the BIG-Bench paper or the specific percentage, which would be necessary to fully answer the question.
